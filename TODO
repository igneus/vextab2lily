TODO

- default note duration is 1/8 like in VexFlow, not 1/4 as usual in LilyPond
- option not to start a new score at each tabstave keyword, but to
   check for possible key change and continue in a single score
   (because VexFlow can't wrap long lines and thus many short staves
   have to be written, which is not logical to do in LilyPond)
